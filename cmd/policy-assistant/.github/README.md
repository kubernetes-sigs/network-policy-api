> [!NOTE]
> The workflows in this folder are not run and were copied/modified from the Cyclonus repository (https://github.com/mattfenwick/cyclonus), from which Policy Assistant is derived.

If you'd like to run one of these workflows, please copy it to the .github/ folder in the root of this repo (network-policy-api), then delete the file in this folder.

The workflows within are primarily to run the test framework on different CNIs (for more info, see #154).
