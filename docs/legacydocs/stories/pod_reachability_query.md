# Pod Reachability Query

## User Story

As a policy creator or developer, I want to query the network policy enforcement
engine to ask if a specific type of network traffic (IP protocol and port) is
permissible between two pods in a specific direction. If this is not
permissible, I would like the query results to explain what policies (either
egress and/or ingress) prevented the network connection.

* What questions do we want to answer with this query?

* Not only why dropped, but what if policy explicitly allowed -- overriding
policies for example. We need to better generalize this.
