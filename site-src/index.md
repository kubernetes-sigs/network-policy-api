## What is the Network Policy API Project?

The network policy API subgroup is a part of [SIG Network](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/sig-network),
formed to address further work involving Kubernetes network security beyond the core NetworkPolicy v1 resource.
The [`network-policy-api`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/network-policy-api/) repository contains APIs which are
created and maintained by this subgroup.

## APIs

We refer to "APIs" in the plural here because this project will house
multiple K8s CRD resources geared towards different users and use cases.

### Active (APIs undergoing active development)

- [ClusterNetworkPolicy](api-overview.md#the-clusternetworkpolicy-resource)

### Previous (APIs that have evolved to the next stage and are no longer actively developed)

- [AdminNetworkPolicy](https://network-policy-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#policy.networking.k8s.io%2fv1alpha1.AdminNetworkPolicy) and 
[BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy](https://network-policy-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#policy.networking.k8s.io%2fv1alpha1.BaselineAdminNetworkPolicy)

### Future (Possible APIs to be created in the future)

- DeveloperNetworkPolicy
